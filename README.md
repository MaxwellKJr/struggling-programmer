# ðŸš€ The Struggling Project ðŸ’»

This is a blog/type info website for a project I'm currently calling, "The Struggling Project." This will primarily be a place for developers to share their struggles and lowest moments they had as a they were learning how to code.

The plan is to help new and aspiring developers that the struggle is real and it's never easy for MOST programmers.

As much as we go to Stack Overflow to seek help with our code, this website will be a place to seek help for our minds.

## Built with:

- ReactJS
- NextJS
- TailwindCSS
- Still deciding ðŸ¤” between Strapi & Contentful
